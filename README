For "normal" LSST baseline evaluations, use the files in "baseline".
 y4 is now the baseline y filter, so is called simply 'y' in this
 directory.  Note that while this is our current baseline performance,
 it represents our current idealized view of LSST behavior and does
 not include degradation of performance over time or with various
 contaminants.

For SRD evaluations of limiting magnitudes where X=1.0 is the desired
atmosphere, use srd-1777.  This collection is identical to the
baseline set, except for the atmosphere added to the total throughput
(thus total throughput and atmosphere are different).

The files in 'imsim' are related to the throughputs used in the imsim
simulations. The 'goal' directory holds the throughputs used as goals
for imsim development at the time of tagging (of this SVN directory),
and the 'actual' directory holds the imsim actual throughputs, at the
current time (as this is imported from the imsim directory).

Megacam and sdss should be self-explanatory, but hold total system
throughputs for megacam and SDSS, as published by those telescopes.

The directory 'atmos' contains various airmass atmospheres.

More information is available in README files within each directory.
